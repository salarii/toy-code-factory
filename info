I'm still working on this, but I’m hoping to finish up soon and move on to other things.

Here is the approach I’m using—it’s been fun and moves quickly, even if I’m not entirely sure where the final version will land:

    "I started with some Shadow Coding to set the foundation, then moved into an aggressive Vibe Coding phase. This left the app full of features but essentially a 'zombie.' To wrap things up, I’m Silver Lining the project—focusing on a functional 'happy path' so the app actually works for its main purpose, without getting bogged down in heavy-duty testing or validation for now."

A Simple Breakdown of the Terms

1. Shadow Coding

    The Simple View: Creating a "ghost blueprint."

    What it is: Writing simplified instructions or "pseudo-code" that an AI can easily follow. It’s like drawing a rough sketch of a house before you start building, so the AI knows exactly where the walls should go.

2. Vibe Coding

    The Simple View: Building by "feel" at high speed.

    What it is: Using AI to generate a lot of features quickly based on a general concept (the "vibe"). The app looks complete, but because it was built so fast, it might not even run yet—making it a Zombie Product.

3. Silver Lining (I made this one up—I like the 'Silver Lining' imagery here because it’s about finally lining everything up, and this step is too important to skip.)

    The Simple View: Finding the one path that works.

    What it is: Instead of fixing every single bug, you focus only on the Silver Lining—the specific "sliver" of functionality a user needs to successfully use the app (the Happy Path). It makes the program functional for its main task without spending weeks on details no one sees.
